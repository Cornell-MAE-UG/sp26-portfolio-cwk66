## About Me


<img src="assets/images/_DSC8696.JPG">

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a current second year at Cornell University (c/o '28) majoring in Mechanical Engineering.  My primary engineering interests include spacecraft mechanisms and mechatronics.  At Cornell, I am a mechanical engineer for the Space System Design Studio's Sailing to the Stars project.  My organization, Little STEM Initiative, strives to bring accessible STEM education to all students regardless of circumstances or background, through engaging workshops and interactive activities, building an encouraging community of students in STEM.  I have been learning Japanese in school since 1st grade, and hope to extend our initiative to partners in Japan.  I also work at the US Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, DC, on projects ranging from CubeSats to hypersonics as a part of the Naval Center for Space Technology (NCST).  My goal through engineering is to innovate impactful and tangible solutions to real-world problems.
