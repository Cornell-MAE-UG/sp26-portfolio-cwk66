In our Intro to Mechanical Design, MAE 2250, class, we were tasked with developing a solution to address the growing population of the invasive Spotted Lanternfly. Since 2014, spotted lanternflies (SLF) have permeated through the north east, feeding on produce such as grapes and infecting over 70 plant species, threatening agriculture and biodiversity. The economic impacts of this invasive species have been estimated at $324 million annually.

So far, we are in the conceptual stage of defining our problem and brainstorming solutions.

Here is our most recent Client Outline and Pitch:



**Proposed Solutions for Managing Spotted Lanternflies in Vineyards**

**Team:** Lanternfly Bye-Bye

**Client(s):** Cornell CALS Extension / E\&J Gallo Winery / National Grape  

   Since 2014, spotted lanternflies (SLF) have permeated the northeast, feeding on produce such as grapes and infecting over 70 plant species, threatening agriculture and biodiversity. In 2025, the National Association of American Wineries valued New York’s wine industry at $16.81 billion. This high-value industry has been impacted by SLF, who damage grapevines and contaminate harvest. Below are two ideas our group has for addressing the issue. We appreciate any feedback you have for us.

### Poisonous Tree of Heaven
Our first idea focuses on managing the population of spotted lanternflies using a decoy tree of heaven. Our team would design a small container and fill it with a mix of tree of heaven sap and a toxin. Attracted by the sap, the lanternflies will dig into the container and ingest the toxin. Otherwise, the container can be equipped with a weight-activated nozzle that would douse the lanternflies in a toxic mix, similar to what many households currently use. The benefits of this product are the decoys are easily scalable and stackable, and they are able to protect the harvesters from the lanternflies while also working to reduce the fly population. By the end of the semester, our goal is to have a finalized trap and, ideally, have tested it in a real environment to see its effectiveness. 

### Essential Oils
Our second proposal attempts to prevent the spotted lanternflies from entering the vineyard by dettering them with essential oils.  By creating individual diffusers to place around the vineyard, the flies will not enter, and the plants will remain unharmed. Ideally, this idea could be developed to include a way to harm the lanternflies as well as deter them in order to help control the population and further protect the vineyard. This product would be nontoxic to surrounding plants and other animals, and would not require much maintence while protecting harvesters from the lanternflies.

## Key risks / unknowns

- Placement of the products is crucial. Because we are using a two-step solution, including attraction and detraction, we want to make sure we detract the flies into the attraction termination sites and not the other way around. Due to our budget and time constraints, we will have to rely on secondary research and data such as wind speed and direction.

-  Plant-safe compounds. Both of our proposed solutions involve liquid compounds to deter and remove lanternflies. The compounds used in the final solution will need to be safe for the grapes and approved by the FDA.

## Questions for the client
1. **Have you found anything that is effective at killing spotted lanternflies?**  
   *Decision affected: What measure to use to narrow down the population (toxins, phsyical means, etc)*
2. **Are spotted lanternflies deterred by other factors such as locations of the vineyards or human presence?**  
   *Decision affected: How to best implement our product* 
3. **Are there any parts of our plans that raise conerns for you?**  
   *Decision affected: Next steps*
